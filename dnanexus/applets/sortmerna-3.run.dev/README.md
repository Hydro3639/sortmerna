# Applet for running Sortmerna using binaries provided as input

This applet is handy for testing the Sortmerna code changes. The new code can be built on DNANexus using e.g. [sortmerna-3.build.on.u16asset](https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna/tree/master/dnanexus/applets/sortmerna-3.build.on.u16asset), and the new binaries passed to this applet as parameters.
